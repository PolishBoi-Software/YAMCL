# YAMCL
A Minecraft launcher that tries to be good.

# Features
- Both MS login and offline login

- Mod loader support
- Language support (Currently supports English and Polish)

# Why?
I was bored. I don't regret making this, though...!

# Discord Server
That's right! YAMCL has a Discord server now!<br>[Click here to join!](https://discord.gg/8KAtkftPDu)

# Website
How long until I stop trying to advertise YAMCL? Probably never, I wanna get people to use it but I don't wanna force them.<br>Anyway here is the website: https://polishboi-software.github.io/YAMCL (Must be exactly that!)
