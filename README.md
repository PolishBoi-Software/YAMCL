# YAMCL
A Minecraft launcher that tries to be good.

# Features
- Microsoft Authentication
- Instances (Saved in user's AppData)
- Good looking UI (Thank you, [CuoreUI](https://github.com/owtysm2/CuoreUI)!)
- Mod loader support

# Why?
I was bored. I don't regret making this, though...!<br>This is also a personal project.

# Discord Server
That's right! YAMCL has a Discord server now!
